merge_ips is PostgreSQL extension that implements merging of IP addresses in a
way that does not include gaps in the resulting subnets. It aims to be purely
database implementation for users who do not want to use external application,
such as the Perl implementation Net::CIDR::Lite
(http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-CIDR-Lite/Lite.pm).


Installation
------------

1. make PG_CONFIG=<path to pg_config of your PG installation> install

2. Connect to your database

3. CREATE EXTENSION merge_ips;


Use
---

The input values are expected in a form of inet[] array. The merge_ips()
function returns a set of subnets that contain the input addresses.

SELECT merge_ips.merge_ips(ARRAY[
       '10.0.52.0/30',
       '10.0.52.16/30',
       '10.0.52.4/30',
       '10.0.52.20/30']::inet[]);

   merge_ips   
---------------
 10.0.52.0/29
 10.0.52.16/29
(2 rows)


Alternatively you can use merge_ips_array() function. The only difference is
that it returns an array instead of set:

SELECT merge_ips.merge_ips_array(ARRAY[
       '10.0.52.0/30',
       '10.0.52.16/30',
       '10.0.52.4/30',
       '10.0.52.20/30']::inet[]);

       merge_ips_array        
------------------------------
 {10.0.52.0/29,10.0.52.16/29}
(1 row)
